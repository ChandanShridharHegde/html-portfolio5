<p>A class in C++ is a fundamental concept that leads to object-oriented programming. It acts as a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of the class. Think of a class as a custom data type that groups together data and functions that operate on that data.

    <br>For example, if you imagine a class called Car, this class would define the common properties and behaviors that all cars share. These properties, like the number of wheels, speed limit, and mileage, are known as data members. The behaviors, such as applying brakes or increasing speed, are implemented as member functions within the class.
    
    <br>When you create a specific car object from the Car class, that object will have its own set of data for speed, mileage, etc., but it will also have the same functions to control these properties. This approach allows for organized and modular code, where different objects can be created from the same class blueprint but with their own unique values.
