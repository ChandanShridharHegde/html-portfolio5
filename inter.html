<p>Inheritance is a fundamental feature of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++, allowing a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. This mechanism enables the creation of a new class (called a subclass or derived class) based on an existing class (called a superclass or base class), promoting code reusability and extending functionality.

</p>
<h2>Key Concepts of Inheritance</h2>
<ul>
    <li><span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold ;">Sub Class (Derived Class):</span> This is the class that inherits properties and behaviors from another class. It can add new features or modify existing ones, allowing for the extension and specialization of the base class.</li>

    <li><span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold ;">Super Class (Base Class):</span> This is the class whose properties and methods are inherited by the subclass. The base class defines common attributes and behaviors that can be shared across multiple derived classes.
    </li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Reusability Through Inheritance</h2>
    <p>One of the main advantages of inheritance is reusability. When developing a new class, instead of writing all the code from scratch, you can inherit from an existing class that already has some of the desired functionality. This way, the new class automatically gains access to the methods and attributes of the base class, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.

       <br> For example, suppose you have a Vehicle class that defines common properties like speed and fuelCapacity, and methods like startEngine() and stopEngine(). If you want to create a Car class, instead of writing all these properties and methods again, you can simply derive the Car class from the Vehicle class. The Car class will inherit the Vehicle class's properties and methods, and you can add specific features like airConditioner or applyBrakes() to the Car class.</p>
