<p>An object in C++ is a concrete instance of a class, representing an identifiable entity with specific characteristics and behaviors. While a class serves as a blueprint, an object is the actual entity created based on that blueprint. 

   <br> When a class is defined, it doesn't consume memory. However, when you create an object from that class (i.e., instantiate the class), memory is allocated for that object to store its data members and member functions. This object will occupy space in memory and have a unique address, similar to how a record in Pascal or a structure in C might work.
    
   <br> In a running program, objects can interact with each other by sending and receiving messages. This means one object can call methods (member functions) of another object. Importantly, objects don't need to know the internal details of each other's data or code. They just need to understand the type of messages (methods) they can send and the type of responses (return values) they will receive. This encapsulation allows objects to be self-contained units that interact in a predictable and controlled manner, which is a key aspect of object-oriented programming.</p>
